Level 1 : Physical Hard Drive - name, size (GB)

Level 2 : Physical Volume - Factors: (1 physical hard drive, user provided name, UUID).
                            Condition :(Only created with hard drive).
                            Extra Information: Can be added to Volume Groups (Level 3). A 1 to 1 ratio with physical
                            hard drive, a physical hard drive can only belong to 1 physical vol.

Level 3: Volume Groups - Factors: (User provided name, UUID)
                         Consists : (Consists of a list of Physical Volumes(Level 2), and a list of

                         Return Values : the size of the Volume Group after adding up all Physical Volumes
                                       : the size left of the Volume group after subtracting each Logical Volume

Level 4: Logical Volumes: Factors: (User provided name, UUID, an associated volume group)
                          Condition: CANNOT exist without an associated volume group
